1. Try Split CompResults by Season
	Issue: Used AllYears Method to provide a list of seasons and added season route so it gets passed as a parameter such as
	{compID}/{Season} but MVC has an issue Calling compResult from Competition so left as is for now.

2. CompResultAPIController
	Issue with Post Method. Want to check if CompID, Season and GolferID all in DB already then dont add but is always returning
	as true as all already exist but not together. Not sure why && isn't concatenating request instead of treating all as 
	individual requests. **This shoudl work, taken from upload var foundMatch = db.Comp_Results.Where(x => x.CompetitionID == comp.CompetitionID && x.Season == comp.Season && x.GolferID == comp.GolferID).FirstOrDefault();**
	Issue 2: Post is working as is i.e. var foundCompRes = db.Comp_Results.FirstOrDefault(x => x.CompResultID == comp_Result.CompResultID);
	but still shows an error in Postman even though item gets added. **Fixed**

3. Add Admin Authorisation for API - All 

4. Add Admin Authorisation for UI - Only C, U, D... R (Read) should be accessible for all
	

	** look add why Dermots Start up method not adding NetRoles and details. - Can add entries in DB anyway if needs
	be **
	** Looks NetRoles - add myself as Admin, create other roles, user (subscriber) and viewer
