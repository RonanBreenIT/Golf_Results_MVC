1. Try Split CompResults by Season
	Issue: Used AllYears Method to provide a list of seasons and added season route so it gets passed as a parameter such as
	{compID}/{Season} but MVC has an issue Calling compResult from Competition so left as is for now.

2. CompResultAPIController
	Issue with Post Method. Want to check if CompID, Season and GolferID all in DB already then dont add but is always returning
	as true as all already exist but not together. Not sure why && isn't concatenating request instead of treating all as 
	individual requests.
	Issue 2: Post is working as is i.e. var foundCompRes = db.Comp_Results.FirstOrDefault(x => x.CompResultID == comp_Result.CompResultID);
	but still shows an error in Postman even though item gets added.
